# Large Scale Examination of Early-Age Sex Differences in Neurotypical, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Toddlers with Other Developmental Conditions.

## System Requirements
Primary and cluster analyses were performed using **RStudio 2024.09.0+375**, and longitudinal analyses were conducted in **Mplus 8.3**. The software is compatible with both **Windows** and **macOS** operating systems.

## Installation Guide
**R** and **RStudio** are available as open-source software. You can install them by visiting [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/) and [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/).
**Mplus** requires a license. We used Mplus provided by the **University of Florida**. You can obtain a license from [https://www.statmodel.com/](https://www.statmodel.com/).

### Installation Time
Installation time for R, RStudio, and Mplus is relatively short, typically around **5-10 minutes**, depending on your computer's specifications.

## Demo and Instructions for Use
The code provided is fully commented to guide users through analyzing the data. To replicate the results presented in the manuscript tables, please follow the comments in the scripts. Users are expected to:

1. Load the provided dataset.
2. Run the corresponding R or Mplus code as per the analysis described.
3. Review outputs, which should match the tables in the manuscript.

The runtime for general analyses is minimal, while **cluster analyses and validations** may take approximately **1-2 hours**, depending on the computer's processing power.

## Reproducibility
We encourage you to use the provided dataset and scripts to reproduce all the quantitative results included in the manuscript.
